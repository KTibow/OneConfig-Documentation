# Vigilance Compatibility (VCAL)

## Accessor

OneConfig's Compatibility system allows mods that use Vigilance to be edited right inside the OneConfig GUI - hence the name **Accessor**. This means that the user can open, edit and save the config as if it was a Vigilance config - but with the beautiful, united OneConfig GUI.&#x20;

Now, of course, this is not a permanent solution. It is not as reliable as the OneConfig configuration system if it was used directly, so it is still strongly recommended that if you (as a developer) want to use OneConfig in your mod, you use the OneConfig configuration system instead.&#x20;

## Migrator

OneConfig is equipped with a .toml file parser and converter, allowing for Vigilance mods with existing configs to be migrated to OneConfig ones, allowing the developer to switch and their users not have to worry about lost configs. This all happens automatically in the background - so no implementation information here!



## To ex-Vigilance users

If you are switching, thanks for choosing us! Make sure to check out the[#migrator](vigilance-compatibility-vcal.md#migrator "mention") and the [creating-a-config.md](../creating-a-config.md "mention") for more help on that. OneConfig is designed to be easy to use and understand, and the API language is very similar to help you out.
